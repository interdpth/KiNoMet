Match what's around

use full braces
void function()
{
}


if writing a function that's different use #ifdefs
try to run gba code in wram
auto is okay we work with like 4 bytes max, it's whatever


for pointer manipulation, maniuplate bytes deliberatly.

unsigned char* data = someStruct;

int memberType = *data; data+=1;
int size=*(int*)data;data+=4;
