meteo uses cinepak, by limiting fps to 20

hit list: 
maybe look into setting pixel type from rgb to 

 AV_PIX_FMT_RGB555BE,  ///< packed RGB 5:5:5, 16bpp, (msb)1X 5R 5G 5B(lsb), big-endian   , X=unused/undefined
    AV_PIX_FMT_RGB555LE,  ///< packed RGB 5:5:5, 16bpp, (msb)1X 5R 5G 5B(lsb), little-endian, X=unused/undefined

    could literally be 1 to 1 with gba, just have to & 0x7FFF before it hits pal? 

    make a slow version first that translates the whole frame from 24 to 16bit on console. 
unlike meteo that uses windows media library Converters, we will just take input video
set audio into one file
add video to another 
remux manually

make player

port to C
